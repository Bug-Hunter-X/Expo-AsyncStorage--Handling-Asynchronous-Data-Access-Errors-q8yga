This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo, specifically when trying to access data before it's fully loaded.  It often manifests as a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getItem')` or a similar error related to accessing a property of `undefined`. This typically happens when you call `AsyncStorage.getItem` before the asynchronous operation has completed.
